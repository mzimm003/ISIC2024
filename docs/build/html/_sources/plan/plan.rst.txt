Plan
=====
Use a transformer based classifier to classify images. Leverage extra 
information in training set to create a teacher model. Create main model using
only what is available on test set, trained traditionally (cross entropy
loss) as well as distillation loss. Preprocess data with feature reduction
techniques to try to narrow the number of features trained on.

Steps
-----

#. Perform feature reduction Identify most relevant features in training set.
